								<h2>To cut a long story short..</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>My full name is <strong>Rafał Robert Kelm</strong>. I was born in Katowice, Poland. From an early age I enjoyed mathematics and science and was interested in new technologies. On the other hand, I was sort of a mixture, because of artistic skills I had.</p>
									<p>I passed through an advanced mathematics / physics profile in high school, when I decided to become a lawyer. For some reasons, I set for a completely different path of my personal development. </p>
									<p>In 2011, as a result of certain achievements at the law school, I’ve received a six-month scholarship at the Maurer School of Law (University of Indiana, Bloomington, US). </p>
									<p>After returning to Poland, I decided not to pursue the typical attorney career, but to develop in other direction – a direction that will allow me for the broader contact with analytical thinking and numbers. I went through quite demanding exams for a licensed tax advisor and became one of the tax lawyers in Big4 companies.</p>
									<p>Professional work taught me a lot. One of the conclusions from these years of experience is that you have to build on the areas in which you have the most natural potential to grow and succeed.</p>
									<p>Surprise, surprise.. I found out that by the nature of things, <strong>I am a NERD</strong>… (extrovert, but still a NERD).</p>
									<p>I enjoy solving complicated analytical problems rather than struggling as a manager in demanding business environment.</p>
									<p>Having all this in mind, I was looking for the adequate direction to move on. Months and months of reflections indicated me the right way.</p>
									<p>I found out that coding is much more consistent with my personality and talents than anything else. </p>
									<p>In late 2018 I decided to take a courageous step towards becoming a programmer. I am motivated to change my life for better. Realizing my passions and coming back happy from work is what I want to give to my family and myself in next years.</p>
									<p>In free time, I like sports and contemplation. During summer I enjoy sailing in Croatia.</p>
